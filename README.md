# judoKit Objective-C iOS SDK

This is the official judoKit iOS SDK written in Objective-C. It incorporates our mobile specific security toolkit, [judoShield](https://github.com/judopay/judoshield), with additional modules to enable easy native integration of payments. While the JudoKitObjC Framework has Swift annotations, we highly recommend using the original [judoKit](https://github.com/judopay/JudoKit) which is written in Swift.

##### **\*\*\*Due to industry-wide security updates, versions below 6.0 of this SDK will no longer be supported after 1st Oct 2016. For more information regarding these updates, please read our blog [here](http://hub.judopay.com/pci31-security-updates/).*****

### What is this project for?

judoKit is a framework for integrating easy, fast and secure payments in your app with [judo](https://www.judopay.com/). It contains an exhaustive in-app payments and security toolkit that makes integration simple and quick.
